This makes it particularly slow in MATLAB simulation. Therefore C++ implementation is desirable for the sake of speed. This template provides some useful C++ classes for users to simulate particle filters. We try to use the STL as much as possible to provide user with an intuitive and consistant interface.\r\n\r\nwritten by [Zhiyuan Weng](http://www.ece.sunysb.edu/~zyweng) (zhiyuan.weng@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nDistributed under [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).\r\n\r\n"}
