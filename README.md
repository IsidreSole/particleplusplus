Particle++
=======================================
a C++ particle filter library

Particle filters or sequential Monte Carlo methods require sampling a large amount of particles at each iteration. This makes it particularly slow in MATLAB simulation. Therefore C++ implementation is desirable for the sake of speed. This library provides some useful C++ classes for users to simulate particle filters.
