a C++ implementation of particle filter
=======================================
Particle filters or sequential Monte Carlo methods require sampling a large amount of particles at each iteration. This makes it particularly slow in MATLAB simulation. Therefore C++ implementation is desirable for the sake of speed. This library provides a user-friendly interface for users to simulate particle filters using C++.
